# Snake-Game-using-tkinter
The code is an implementation of a basic Snake game using the Tkinter library in Python. 
It creates a window, sets up the game canvas, and defines classes for the Snake and Food objects. 
It also includes functions for controlling the snake's movement, checking for collisions, and handling game over conditions.
To run the code, you need to have Tkinter installed. 
After running the code, you will see a window with the Snake game. 
The objective is to control the snake using the arrow keys and guide it to eat the food (white oval). 
Each time the snake eats the food, the score will increase by one. 
The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
